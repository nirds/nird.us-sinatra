        Why Ruby? Ruby is ver­sat­ile, easy to code in, and hon­es&shy;tly a lot of fun. It’s used by thou­sands of com­pan­ies and mil­lions of people every day. It’s also easy to learn, be­cause Ruby was writ­ten for hu­mans, not ma­chines. If you’ve nev­er touched code be­fore, Ruby is a great place to start. For ex­per­i­en&shy;ced pro­gram­mers, we prom­ise Ruby will rap­idly be­come your new fa­vor­ite pro­gram­ming lan­guage. Here at NIRD, we’re pas­sion­ate about Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails, and we can’t wait to share that ex­per­i­en&shy;ce with you.

        “This in&shy;struct&shy;or knows her stuff, and is so gen&shy;er&shy;ous with shar&shy;ing her hard-earned know&shy;ledge, not just about Ruby on Rails but about pro&shy;gram&shy;ming and be&shy;ing part of the Open Source com&shy;munity in gen&shy;er&shy;al. Wheth&shy;er or not I end up us&shy;ing Rails in the fu&shy;ture (which is de&shy;pend&shy;ent upon my work en&shy;vir&shy;on&shy;ment, not on how I feel about Rails; I like it very much!), I will be a bet&shy;ter pro&shy;gram&shy;mer in gen&shy;er&shy;al thanks to the ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ence I had in this class."

        I loved the last day of the class, where we worked on pairs and had fun while learn&shy;ing and cod&shy;ing in Ruby. The in&shy;struct&shy;or was will&shy;ing to an&shy;swer many ques&shy;tions. She was ex&shy;tremely know&shy;ledge&shy;able on ruby gems, plu&shy;gins and de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment tools. She was very help&shy;ful when we got stuck on something. I thought the class was ex&shy;cel&shy;lent.” Jose - Ore&shy;gon State Uni&shy;versity

            The Ruby Ko&shy;ans are a bit more ex&shy;ist&shy;en&shy;tial than Ruby&shy;Monk, but the same prin&shy;ciple ap&shy;plies: learn by do&shy;ing. If you've al&shy;ways wanted to spend a few years on a moun&shy;tain&shy;top learn&shy;ing the secrets of the uni&shy;verse this might be a good place to start. We can't prom&shy;ise you'll reach en&shy;light&shy;en&shy;ment, but your cod&shy;ing skills will im&shy;prove rap&shy;idly if you keep at it con&shy;sist&shy;ently.
