  intro: "Why Ruby? Ruby is ver&shy;sat&shy;ile, easy to code in, and hon&shy;estly a lot of fun. It’s used by thou&shy;sands of com&shy;pan&shy;ies and mil&shy;lions of people every day. It’s also easy to learn, be&shy;cause Ruby was writ&shy;ten for hu&shy;mans, not ma&shy;chines. If you’ve nev&shy;er touched code be&shy;fore, Ruby is a great place to start. For ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;enced pro&shy;gram&shy;mers, we prom&shy;ise Ruby will rap&shy;idly be&shy;come your new fa&shy;vor&shy;ite pro&shy;gram&shy;ming lan&shy;guage. Here at NIRD, we’re pas&shy;sion&shy;ate about Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails, and we can’t wait to share that ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ence with you."
