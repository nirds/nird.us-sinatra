  intro: "Why Ruby? Ruby is versatile, easy to code in, and honestly a lot of fun. It’s used by thousands of companies and millions of people every day. It’s also easy to learn, because Ruby was written for humans, not machines. If you’ve never touched code before, Ruby is a great place to start. For experienced programmers, we promise Ruby will rapidly become your new favorite programming language. Here at NIRD, we’re passionate about Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails, and we can’t wait to share that experience with you."
